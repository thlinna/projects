# EU Digital Europe Programme Proposal Generator - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the high-level tasks for implementing the EU Digital Europe Programme Proposal Generator, based on `PRD.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Implementation Tasks

1.  **Project Setup & Core Utilities:**
    *   [ ] Finalize directory structure.
    *   [ ] Set up basic logging framework.
    *   [ ] Implement configuration management (e.g., for LLM keys, settings).
    *   [ ] Define core data structures/models (e.g., Proposal, Idea, Evaluation, AgentInteraction).
    *   [ ] Implement common utility functions.

2.  **Data Storage Layer Implementation:**
    *   [ ] Choose and set up the local database solution (e.g., SQLite, DuckDB, file-based JSON/YAML).
    *   [ ] Implement Data Access Object (DAO) or repository for Proposals.
    *   [ ] Implement DAO/repository for Ideas.
    *   [ ] Implement DAO/repository for Evaluations.
    *   [ ] Implement DAO/repository for Agent Interactions / History.
    *   [ ] Implement DAO/repository for storing reference materials (if applicable).

3.  **Agent Collaboration Layer Implementation:**
    *   [ ] Implement the base `Agent` abstract class or interface.
    *   [ ] Implement the agent communication bus or framework for message passing.
    *   [ ] Implement `ProgrammeExpertAgent`.
    *   [ ] Implement `CreativeIdeatorAgent`.
    *   [ ] Implement `StartupFounderAgent`.
    *   [ ] Implement `PracticalJudgeAgent`.
    *   [ ] Implement `ProposalWriterAgent`.
    *   [ ] Implement LLM interaction module (abstraction for different LLMs).
    *   [ ] Integrate LLM interaction into agent implementations.
    *   [ ] Implement optional web browsing capability for agents (securely).

4.  **Workflow Orchestration Layer Implementation:**
    *   [ ] Implement the `WorkflowEngine` class.
    *   [ ] Define states and transitions for the proposal generation workflow.
    *   [ ] Implement logic for task assignment to agents based on workflow state.
    *   [ ] Implement progress tracking mechanisms.
    *   [ ] Implement convergence detection logic (when to stop iterating).
    *   [ ] Integrate `WorkflowEngine` with `AgentCollaborationLayer`.
    *   [ ] Integrate `WorkflowEngine` with `DataStorageLayer`.

5.  **User Interface Layer Implementation:**
    *   [ ] Choose UI framework (e.g., Streamlit, Gradio, custom web app with Electron/Tauri).
    *   [ ] Implement Project Initiation screen/view.
    *   [ ] Implement Progress Monitoring dashboard/view.
    *   [ ] Implement Agent Process Visualization component.
    *   [ ] Implement Historical Data Browser view.
    *   [ ] Implement mechanism for optional user input during workflow.
    *   [ ] Integrate UI components with `WorkflowOrchestrationLayer` (e.g., via API or callbacks).

6.  **Integration & End-to-End Testing:**
    *   [ ] Integrate all layers (UI, Workflow, Agents, Data).
    *   [ ] Develop end-to-end test cases based on User Journeys in `PRD.md`.
    *   [ ] Execute end-to-end tests.
    *   [ ] Debug and refine based on test results.
    *   [ ] Perform performance testing (especially agent processing time).

7.  **Documentation & Finalization:**
    *   [ ] Write/update `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.
    *   [ ] Add necessary inline code documentation (docstrings, comments).
    *   [ ] Review and finalize `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
    *   [ ] Prepare final application package/build.
