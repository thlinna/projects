# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

This document outlines an AI-native, local application designed to autonomously generate highly successful project proposals for the EU Digital Europe Programme, aiming at securing funding between €10M and €20M per application. The system leverages multiple high-intelligence AI agents (IQ 200+) collaborating iteratively to ideate, refine, and compose compelling, winning applications. Users can initiate processes, observe progress, contribute inputs, and review historical decisions.

## Goals and Objectives

- **Primary Goal:** Generate winning applications consistently securing EU Digital Europe Programme funding.
- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Build reusable intelligence for creating successful grant and business proposals.
  - Accumulate a database of proposals and insights for learning and iterative improvement.
  - Ensure transparency and user involvement as needed.

## Scope

### Included:
- Autonomous and iterative generation of highly competitive application ideas.
- Collaborative agent-based idea refinement, evaluation, and final proposal writing.
- User interface for initiating projects, tracking progress, reviewing, and providing optional input.
- Local database storing generated ideas, evaluation outcomes, and application drafts.
- Limited web browsing capabilities for idea validation and information gathering.

### Excluded (Initial Release):
- Commercial distribution.
- Full cloud deployment or extensive cloud integrations.

## User Personas / Target Audience

- **Primary User:** Individual researcher or entrepreneur (owner) aiming to generate high-value EU grant applications autonomously and efficiently.

## Functional Requirements

### Must-Have Features:
- **Agent Collaboration:** Five high-IQ agents with specific roles:
  - **Programme Expert:** Deep knowledge of successful Digital Europe Programme criteria.
  - **Creative Ideator:** Generates multiple innovative and viable application ideas.
  - **Startup Founder:** Experienced with EU stakeholders, best practices, and strong networks.
  - **Practical Judge:** Critically evaluates and improves ideas.
  - **Proposal Writer:** Crafts the final, polished, and winning application documents.
- **User Interface:**
  - Clear project initiation and monitoring.
  - Ability to review and optionally influence ongoing agent processes.
  - Access to stored historical data, including previously discarded ideas and decisions.
- **Local Database:**
  - Structured storage for proposals, iterations, ideas, and evaluations.
- **Iterative Workflow:**
  - Non-linear, iterative improvement until no further enhancements are possible.

### Future Features:
- Additional intelligent roles or agents.
- Extended capabilities for other grants, funding programs, or business ideation.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Highly efficient local processing optimized for a MacBook Pro M4 Max with 64GB RAM.
- **Security:** Strictly local operation to ensure data privacy, optional limited internet browsing.
- **Scalability:** Modular agent-based architecture allowing future addition of roles or intelligence upgrades.
- **Quality:** High-level, accurate output compliant with Digital Europe Programme standards.

## User Journeys

1. **Initiation:**
   - User launches the application, optionally inputs an initial idea or allows the system to autonomously begin.
2. **Ideation & Collaboration:**
   - Agents autonomously use best LLM tool to generate, critique, refine, and iterate on proposals.
   - User can review, monitor, and contribute optionally at any stage, but agents should utilise AI to improve their ideas-
3. **Finalization:**
   - Proposal Writer Agent crafts the final application with the help of LLM. 
   - User receives a ready-to-submit application document in .md format
4. **Review & Learning:**
   - User explores historical data for insights into decisions and discarded ideas via UI

## Success Metrics

- Number of successfully funded applications (€10-20M each).
- Efficiency (time from ideation to submission).
- User satisfaction and perceived value.
- Learning and reuse rate of ideas from stored database.

## Timeline

- Immediate initial prototype setup (targeted for completion within 24 hours).
- Iterative improvements based on initial usage and feedback.

## Open Questions / Assumptions

- Exact integration level of internet browsing for agent idea validation.
- Best specific local or cloud-based AI models to achieve optimal results.
