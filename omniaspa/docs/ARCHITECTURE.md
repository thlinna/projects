# EU Digital Europe Programme Proposal Generator - Architecture Design

## 1. System Overview

The EU Digital Europe Programme Proposal Generator is an AI-native, local application designed to autonomously generate highly successful project proposals for the EU Digital Europe Programme. The system leverages multiple high-intelligence AI agents collaborating iteratively to ideate, refine, and compose compelling proposals aimed at securing funding between €10M and €20M per application.

## 2. Architectural Principles

- **Local-First:** All processing and data storage occurs locally on the user's machine
- **Agent-Based Intelligence:** Leverages multiple specialized AI agents working collaboratively
- **Iterative Refinement:** Non-linear improvement process until optimal results are achieved
- **User Transparency:** Clear visibility into agent processes and historical decisions
- **Modularity:** Components are decoupled to allow for future extensions and improvements

## 3. High-Level Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture with the following main components:

## 4. Component Details

### 4.1 User Interface Layer

The UI layer provides the following capabilities:
- Project initiation interface
- Progress monitoring dashboard
- Agent process visualization
- Historical data exploration
- Optional user input mechanisms

**Key Interactions:**
- Sends user commands to the Workflow Orchestration Layer
- Receives status updates and results from the Workflow Orchestration Layer
- Displays proposal drafts, agent interactions, and historical data

### 4.2 Workflow Orchestration Layer

This layer manages the overall proposal generation process:
- Controls the iterative workflow
- Determines when to involve which agents
- Tracks progress and convergence
- Manages the non-linear improvement process
- Decides when the proposal is ready for finalization

**Key Interactions:**
- Receives commands from the UI Layer
- Coordinates the Agent Collaboration Layer
- Retrieves and stores data via the Data Storage Layer
- Provides status updates to the UI Layer

### 4.3 Agent Collaboration Layer

This layer contains the five specialized AI agents that work together to generate proposals:

1. **Programme Expert Agent**
   - Deep knowledge of successful Digital Europe Programme criteria
   - Evaluates ideas against programme requirements
   - Provides guidance on alignment with EU priorities

2. **Creative Ideator Agent**
   - Generates multiple innovative and viable application ideas
   - Proposes novel approaches and concepts
   - Thinks outside conventional boundaries

3. **Startup Founder Agent**
   - Applies experience with EU stakeholders and best practices
   - Ensures proposals have practical implementation paths
   - Leverages knowledge of EU networks and partnerships

4. **Practical Judge Agent**
   - Critically evaluates and improves ideas
   - Identifies weaknesses and suggests improvements
   - Applies rigorous assessment criteria

5. **Proposal Writer Agent**
   - Crafts the final, polished application documents
   - Ensures compelling narrative and structure
   - Optimizes language for maximum impact

**Key Interactions:**
- Receives tasks from the Workflow Orchestration Layer
- Collaborates with other agents through structured information exchange
- Accesses and updates data via the Data Storage Layer
- Returns results to the Workflow Orchestration Layer

### 4.4 Data Storage Layer

The local database stores all information related to the proposal generation process:
- Generated ideas and concepts
- Evaluation results and feedback
- Iteration history and decision trails
- Final and intermediate proposal drafts
- Reference materials and best practices

**Key Interactions:**

## 5. Key Workflows

### 5.1 Proposal Generation Workflow

1. User initiates a new proposal project (optionally providing initial ideas)
2. Workflow Orchestration Layer activates the Creative Ideator Agent to generate initial concepts
3. Programme Expert and Startup Founder Agents evaluate and enhance the ideas
4. Practical Judge Agent critically assesses the concepts
5. Workflow Orchestration Layer manages iterative refinement among agents
6. When sufficient quality is reached, Proposal Writer Agent crafts the final document
7. User receives the completed proposal in .md format

### 5.2 Iterative Refinement Workflow

1. Agents provide feedback on current proposal state
2. Workflow Orchestration Layer identifies areas for improvement
3. Relevant agents are tasked with addressing specific aspects
4. New iterations are evaluated against previous versions
5. Process continues until no further improvements are possible
6. Final version is prepared for user review

## 6. Technical Considerations

### 6.1 Performance Optimization

- Efficient local processing optimized for MacBook Pro M4 Max with 64GB RAM
- Asynchronous agent operations where possible
- Intelligent caching of intermediate results
- Resource management to prevent memory exhaustion

### 6.2 Security and Privacy

- Strictly local operation with no cloud dependencies
- Optional limited internet browsing for research purposes only
- No transmission of proposal data outside the local environment
- Secure storage of all generated content

### 6.3 Extensibility

- Pluggable LLM backends to accommodate technology improvements
- Extensible data schema for supporting additional proposal types

## 7. Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow these principles:

1. **Incremental Development:** Build core components first, then enhance
2. **Test-Driven Development:** Ensure reliability through comprehensive testing
3. **Rapid Prototyping:** Create functional prototype within 24 hours
4. **Continuous Refinement:** Improve based on usage and feedback

## 8. Future Considerations

While out of scope for the initial release, the architecture supports:
- Additional intelligent agent roles
- Extended capabilities for other grants and funding programs
- Business ideation and strategy development
- Integration with external data sources and tools
