# Proposal for Test Persistence Fix

## Introduction

The consortium submitting this proposal, titled **“Proposal for Test Persistence Fix”**, is pleased to present a solution addressing a critical, yet often overlooked, vulnerability in the digital landscape: the lack of robust and verifiable persistence of software test results. Our project, built upon the innovative idea of **“Persistent Data Integrity via Blockchain-Anchored Test Results”**, directly responds to the Digital Europe Programme’s call for proposals by strengthening trust in digital products and services, and fostering the development of secure and reliable digital infrastructure.

Currently, test results – the cornerstone of quality assurance and regulatory compliance – are frequently stored in centralized, mutable databases, susceptible to accidental alteration, malicious tampering, and data loss. This presents significant risks, particularly within highly regulated sectors such as Healthcare, Finance, and Critical Infrastructure, where demonstrable proof of testing and validation is paramount. 

This project will develop a pioneering platform leveraging a permissioned blockchain to immutably store and verify test results. By creating a tamper-proof record encompassing test execution details, input parameters, outputs, and environmental context, we will establish an unprecedented level of trust and accountability in the software development lifecycle.  

Specifically, our solution will focus on the creation of a standardized data format and Application Programming Interface (API) designed for seamless integration with existing Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and widely-used testing frameworks. This will facilitate broad adoption and ensure interoperability across diverse digital ecosystems. 

The resulting platform will not only enhance the reliability and security of digital products but will also actively support compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the forthcoming Artificial Intelligence Act, by providing auditable and verifiable evidence of testing and validation processes. This proposal details a comprehensive plan to deliver a robust, scalable, and impactful solution that directly contributes to the Digital Europe Programme’s objectives of building a secure and trustworthy digital future.

## Methodology

This section details the methodological approach underpinning the ‘Proposal for Test Persistence Fix’ (hereafter ‘the Project’), which aims to deliver ‘Persistent Data Integrity via Blockchain-Anchored Test Results’. Our methodology is structured around a phased, iterative development process, ensuring robust delivery of a scalable and impactful solution addressing critical test persistence challenges across key European sectors – Healthcare, Finance, and Critical Infrastructure. We will adhere to agile principles, fostering flexibility and responsiveness to evolving requirements and technological advancements.

**Phase 1: Requirements Gathering & Standardisation (Months 1-6)**

This initial phase will focus on a thorough understanding of the specific requirements of each target sector and the development of a standardized data format for test results.

*   **Stakeholder Workshops:** We will conduct workshops with representatives from Healthcare, Finance, and Critical Infrastructure organizations to gather detailed requirements regarding test data, security, privacy, and integration with existing systems.
*   **Data Analysis:** We will analyze existing test data formats and identify common elements and variations.
*   **Standardized Data Format Definition:** Based on the requirements and data analysis, we will define a standardized data format for test results, using a widely accepted schema (e.g., JSON Schema). This format will include essential information such as test case ID, input parameters, output results, execution timestamp, and environment details.
*   **Security and Privacy Assessment:** We will conduct a security and privacy assessment to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities in the data format and develop appropriate mitigation strategies.
*   **Deliverable:** A comprehensive requirements document and a finalized standardized data format specification.

**Phase 2: Platform Development (Months 7-18)**

This phase will focus on the development of the blockchain-based platform for storing and verifying test results.

*   **Blockchain Platform Selection:** We will select a suitable permissioned blockchain platform based on factors such as scalability, security, performance, and cost. Hyperledger Fabric is currently the leading candidate due to its modularity and enterprise-grade features.
*   **Smart Contract Development:** We will develop smart contracts to manage the storage and retrieval of test results on the blockchain. These contracts will enforce data integrity and access control policies.
*   **API Development & CI/CD Integration:** A robust and well-documented RESTful API will be developed to facilitate seamless integration with existing CI/CD pipelines and testing frameworks. This API will allow developers to easily submit test results to the blockchain and retrieve verifiable proof of execution. We will develop integration plugins for popular CI/CD tools to streamline the process.
*   **Data Encryption & Privacy Considerations:** All sensitive data will be encrypted both in transit and at rest, adhering to GDPR requirements. We will explore and implement privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as zero-knowledge proofs to further protect data confidentiality.
*   **Deliverable:** A fully functional blockchain-based platform with a RESTful API and integration plugins for popular CI/CD tools.

**Phase 3: Pilot Implementation & Validation (Months 19-24)**

This phase will focus on validating the solution through pilot implementations in each target sector.

*   **Pilot Site Selection:** We will collaborate with representative organisations in Healthcare, Finance, and Critical Infrastructure to serve as pilot sites.
*   **Pilot Implementation & Data Collection:** The platform will be deployed at the pilot sites, and real-world test data will be ingested and stored on the blockchain.
*   **Performance & Scalability Testing:** Rigorous performance and scalability testing will be conducted to assess the platform’s ability to handle large volumes of test data and concurrent requests.
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Pilot site users will participate in UAT to provide feedback on usability, functionality, and integration with existing workflows.
*   **Regulatory Compliance Assessment:** A thorough assessment will be conducted to ensure the solution complies with relevant regulatory requirements (GDPR, AI Act, sector-specific regulations).

**Dissemination & Exploitation:** Throughout the project, we will actively disseminate results through publications, conferences, and open-source contributions. A detailed exploitation plan will be developed to ensure the long-term sustainability and impact of the solution.

This methodology, underpinned by a rigorous and iterative approach, will ensure the successful delivery of a robust, scalable, and impactful solution addressing the critical challenge of test persistence and fostering trust in digital products across key European sectors.
