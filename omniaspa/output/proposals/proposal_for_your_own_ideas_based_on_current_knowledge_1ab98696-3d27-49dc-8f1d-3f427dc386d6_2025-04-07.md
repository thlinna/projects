# Proposal for AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance for Critical Infrastructure using Federated Learning

## Introduction

This proposal, entitled ‘Proposal for your own ideas based on current knowledge’, addresses a critical need for enhanced resilience and efficiency within Europe’s vital critical infrastructure. We propose the development and deployment of ‘AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance for Critical Infrastructure using Federated Learning’ – a novel, distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform designed to proactively identify and mitigate potential failures in key systems such as energy grids and water networks. 

Europe’s critical infrastructure is increasingly vulnerable to aging assets, escalating operational costs, and evolving security threats. Traditional maintenance strategies are often reactive or rely on infrequent, costly inspections. This project directly addresses these challenges by leveraging the power of AI to transition towards a predictive maintenance paradigm, minimizing downtime, optimizing resource allocation, and ultimately bolstering the security of essential services for European citizens.

However, a significant barrier to widespread AI adoption in this sector is data sensitivity and the complex landscape of data sovereignty regulations. This project uniquely overcomes this obstacle through the implementation of Federated Learning (FL). Our platform will enable collaborative model training *without* requiring the sharing of raw, sensitive data between infrastructure operators. This innovative approach ensures full compliance with GDPR and national data protection laws, fostering trust and encouraging participation.

The core of our solution lies in a distributed architecture that combines FL with edge computing capabilities. This allows for real-time anomaly detection and predictive maintenance scheduling directly at the source of data generation, reducing latency and bandwidth requirements. Crucially, the project will focus on the development of standardized data formats and interoperable Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). This commitment to open standards will be paramount in ensuring the long-term sustainability, scalability, and wider adoption of the platform across diverse infrastructure operators and geographical regions. 

This proposal aligns directly with the objectives of the EU Digital Europe Programme, specifically contributing to the development of trustworthy and secure AI, the advancement of data spaces, and the enhancement of digital infrastructure resilience. We are confident that this project will deliver significant economic and societal benefits, positioning Europe at the forefront of intelligent infrastructure management.

## Methodology

### WP1: Data Harmonisation and Federated Learning Framework (Months 1-12)

This work package establishes the foundation for the entire project by addressing the critical challenges of data heterogeneity and privacy.  We will begin by defining a common data model encompassing key asset characteristics, sensor readings, and maintenance records. This model will be developed in close collaboration with our infrastructure operator partners to ensure its relevance and practicality.  

A key deliverable of this WP will be the development of a robust and scalable Federated Learning (FL) framework. This framework will incorporate state-of-the-art FL algorithms, including techniques for handling non-IID data (data that is not independently and identically distributed) and mitigating the impact of malicious actors.  We will explore both centralized and decentralized FL architectures to determine the optimal approach for our use cases.  

**Tasks:**

*   **Data Model Definition:**  Develop a common data model for critical infrastructure assets.
*   **FL Algorithm Selection & Implementation:**  Implement and evaluate various FL algorithms.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Techniques:**  Integrate privacy-enhancing technologies (e.g., differential privacy, homomorphic encryption).
*   **Framework Development & Testing:**  Develop and test the FL framework in a simulated environment.

**Deliverables:**

*   Common Data Model Specification
*   FL Framework Prototype
*   Technical Report on FL Algorithm Performance

### WP2: Anomaly Detection on the Edge (Months 13-24)

Building upon the FL framework established in WP1, this work package focuses on deploying anomaly detection models on edge devices.  We will leverage the distributed nature of FL to train these models using data generated locally at each infrastructure site.  This approach minimizes data transfer requirements and enhances privacy.

We will explore a range of machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection, including supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised techniques.  The selection of the optimal algorithm will be guided by the specific characteristics of each asset and the availability of labeled data.  

**Tasks:**

*   **Algorithm Selection & Training:**  Select and train anomaly detection algorithms for different asset types.
*   **Edge Device Deployment:**  Deploy trained models on edge devices at infrastructure sites.

*   **Performance Evaluation:**  Evaluate the performance of anomaly detection models in a real-world setting.

**Deliverables:**

*   Trained Anomaly Detection Models
*   Edge Device Deployment Plan
*   Real-Time Data Processing Pipelines
*   Performance Evaluation Report

### WP3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling & Resource Optimisation (Months 25-36)

Building upon the anomaly detection capabilities developed in WP2, this WP will focus on developing algorithms for predictive maintenance scheduling and resource optimisation. We will integrate the anomaly detection outputs with asset management systems and maintenance schedules to proactively identify potential failures and optimise maintenance interventions. This will involve developing algorithms that consider factors such as asset criticality, maintenance costs, and resource availability. We will employ simulation and optimisation techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of different maintenance strategies. 

**Tasks:**

*   **Integration with Asset Management Systems:** Integrate anomaly detection outputs with existing asset management systems.
*   **Predictive Maintenance Algorithm Development:** Develop algorithms for predicting asset failures and scheduling maintenance interventions.
*   **Resource Optimisation:** Develop algorithms for optimising maintenance resource allocation.
*   **Simulation and Evaluation:** Evaluate the effectiveness of predictive maintenance strategies through simulation.

**Deliverables:**

*   Predictive maintenance scheduling algorithms

*   Simulation results demonstrating cost savings and improved resource efficiency.

### WP4: Dissemination, Exploitation & Standardisation (Months 1-36)

This cross-cutting WP will ensure the widespread dissemination of project results and the long-term sustainability of the developed solution. We will actively engage with relevant stakeholders (infrastructure operators, policymakers, standardisation bodies) through workshops, conferences, and publications. We will contribute to the development of relevant standards and best practices in the field of AI-powered predictive maintenance. Furthermore, we will develop a comprehensive exploitation plan outlining the commercialisation potential of the developed solution. 

**Tasks:**
