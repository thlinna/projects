# Proposal for Test Persistence Fix: Decentralized Data Provenance for Persistent Test Results (DPPTR)

## Introduction

This proposal, entitled “Proposal for Test Persistence Fix”, directly addresses a critical challenge within the European digital landscape: the reliable and verifiable persistence of software testing results. Modern software development relies heavily on continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, generating vast quantities of test data. However, this data is often ephemeral, vulnerable to loss due to infrastructure failures, data corruption, or malicious compromise, and lacks inherent provenance information. This fragility undermines trust in software quality, hinders reproducibility, and poses significant risks to the integrity of digital services.

Our innovative solution, “Decentralized Data Provenance for Persistent Test Results (DPPTR)”, proposes a paradigm shift in how test results are managed. We aim to establish a robust, blockchain-based system for immutably recording comprehensive test execution provenance data. This extends beyond simple pass/fail indicators to encompass critical metadata including input parameters, execution environment configurations, source code versions, and detailed execution logs. By capturing the *how* and *why* of each test, DPPTR ensures not only the *what* – the result itself – is preserved, but also the context necessary for independent verification and auditability.

This project will leverage a federated architecture, enabling diverse testing infrastructures across Europe to seamlessly contribute to and verify data integrity. This collaborative approach fosters trust, promotes interoperability, and avoids vendor lock-in. DPPTR directly addresses the shortcomings of current testing methodologies by providing verifiable, long-term storage of critical testing metadata, thereby significantly enhancing the reliability, reproducibility, and trustworthiness of European software and digital services. We are confident that DPPTR will deliver a substantial contribution to the Digital Europe Programme’s objectives of strengthening Europe’s technological sovereignty and fostering a secure and resilient digital future.

## Methodology

This section details the methodology employed to achieve the objectives of the ‘Decentralized Data Provenance for Persistent Test Results (DPPTR)’ idea, directly addressing the ‘Proposal for Test Persistence Fix’. Our approach is grounded in a phased, iterative development process, leveraging agile methodologies and incorporating robust validation procedures to ensure the delivery of a high-quality, impactful solution. We will focus on delivering a demonstrably functional prototype, validated through real-world use cases, and prepared for future scalability and integration.

**Phase 1: System Design & Blockchain Selection (Months 1-6)**

This initial phase will focus on detailed system architecture design and the selection of the optimal blockchain technology. We will not simply adopt a ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution, but rather conduct a comparative analysis of leading Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), including Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, and Ethereum-based solutions. Selection criteria will prioritize:

* **Scalability:** The ability to handle a high volume of test provenance data from diverse sources.
* **Privacy & Control:** Supporting a federated architecture where data ownership and access are controlled by contributing testing infrastructures.
* **Interoperability:** Facilitating seamless integration with existing testing frameworks and tools.
* **Energy Efficiency:** Prioritizing environmentally sustainable DLT options.

This analysis will culminate in a detailed technical specification document outlining the chosen blockchain platform, data schema, and communication protocols. The document will also define the security architecture and access control mechanisms. Deliverables for this phase include:

*   **Technical Specification Document:** A comprehensive document detailing the system architecture and design.
*   **Blockchain Platform Selection Report:** A justification for the chosen blockchain platform based on the defined criteria.
*   **Data Schema Definition:** A detailed definition of the data elements to be stored on the blockchain.

**Phase 2: Prototype Development (Months 7-18)**

This phase will focus on developing a functional prototype of the DPPR system. The prototype will include the following components:

*   **Data Ingestion Module:** A module responsible for collecting test execution data from various sources.
*   **Blockchain Integration Module:** A module responsible for interacting with the chosen blockchain platform.
*   **Data Storage Module:** A module responsible for storing test execution data on the blockchain.
*   **API Interface:** An API interface for accessing and querying test execution data.
*   **User Interface (UI):** A basic UI for visualizing and interacting with the system.

We will employ an agile development methodology with short sprints and frequent releases. This will allow us to adapt to changing requirements and ensure that the prototype meets the needs of our stakeholders. Deliverables for this phase include:

*   **Functional Prototype:** A working prototype of the DPPR system.
*   **API Documentation:** Documentation for the API interface.
*   **UI Documentation:** Documentation for the UI.
*   **Code Repository:** A publicly accessible code repository containing the source code for the prototype.

**Phase 3: Validation and Dissemination (Months 19-24)**

This final phase will focus on rigorous validation of the prototype through real-world use cases. We will collaborate with [**Insert Partner Names/Types Here – crucial for EU applications!**] to deploy DPPR within their existing testing environments. This will involve:

*   **Performance Testing:** Evaluating the system’s scalability and performance under realistic load conditions. We will use industry-standard benchmarking tools to measure transaction throughput, latency, and resource utilization.
*   **Security Audits:** Conducting thorough security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We will engage a third-party security firm to conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
*   **Usability Testing:** Gathering feedback from end-users to improve the system’s usability and accessibility. We will conduct user interviews and usability testing sessions to gather feedback on the UI and API.
*   **Demonstration & Dissemination:** Presenting the results of the validation process and demonstrating the benefits of DPPR to a wider audience through publications, presentations, and open-source contributions. We will publish our findings in peer-reviewed journals and present them at relevant conferences. We will also contribute our code to open-source projects and engage with the community.

Deliverables for this phase include:

*   **Validation Report:** A comprehensive report detailing the results of the validation process.
*   **Demonstration Materials:** Materials for demonstrating the benefits of DPPR to a wider audience.
*   **Open-Source Code Repository:** A publicly accessible code repository containing the source code for the DPPR system.
*   **Publications and Presentations:** Publications and presentations detailing the results of the project.

**Risk Mitigation:** We have identified potential risks, including blockchain scalability limitations and integration challenges with legacy testing systems. Our mitigation strategies include proactive performance testing, modular system design, and the adoption of open standards. A detailed risk register will be maintained throughout the project lifecycle. This register will include a description of each risk, its likelihood of occurrence, its potential impact, and the mitigation strategies that will be employed to address it.

This methodology ensures a robust, iterative, and validated approach to delivering a solution that directly addresses the ‘Proposal for Test Persistence Fix’ and contributes to a more trustworthy and reproducible software development ecosystem.
