# Core Architecture & Strategy

## 1. Architecture Principles

- **Maintainability**:  
  Prioritize clean architecture and modular design. Clearly separate layers (presentation, business logic, data access).

- **Scalability**:  
  Design components and services with horizontal scalability in mind. Avoid stateful dependencies when possible.

- **Consistency**:  
  Follow established project conventions rigorously to reduce cognitive load for developers.

- **Loose Coupling & High Cohesion**:  
  Design components to minimize interdependencies, facilitating easier testing, deployment, and refactoring.

## 2. Project Strategy

- **Incremental Development**:  
  Implement features incrementally, testing each increment thoroughly before continuing.

- **Refactoring & Technical Debt**:  
  Regularly schedule refactoring activities to reduce technical debt proactively.

- **Documentation & Communication**:  
  Clearly document architecture decisions, key abstractions, and interactions between components.

## 3. Technology Decisions

- Choose technologies and libraries that are widely supported, actively maintained, and fit long-term project goals.

- Regularly review external dependencies to ensure they align with your project's quality, security, and maintainability standards.

- Evaluate the impact of introducing new tools carefully, prioritizing stability and maintainability over short-term convenience.

## 4. Quality Assurance

- Integrate automated tests deeply into your development lifecycle (unit, integration, and end-to-end).

- Continuously monitor system health, performance, and security in all environments.

- Actively enforce agreed-upon quality standards through automation, code reviews, and CI/CD pipelines.

## 5. Continuous Improvement

- Regularly assess architecture effectiveness against business needs.

- Encourage feedback from the development team regarding architecture pain points and improvement opportunities.

- Adapt and improve guidelines based on regular retrospectives, aligning project evolution closely with practical realities.
