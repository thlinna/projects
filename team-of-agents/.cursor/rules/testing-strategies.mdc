# Testing Strategies

## Unit Testing
- Cover critical business logic thoroughly using unit tests.
- Tests must run in isolation without external dependencies (use mocks or stubs).

## Integration Testing
- Perform integration tests with realistic database scenarios.
- Validate schema migrations using integration tests to ensure data integrity.

## Database Testing
- Include tests for each database migration step.
- Regularly validate database constraints and triggers.

## Supabase & External Services
- Create isolated testing environments for Supabase services.
- Use Docker containers or testing instances to emulate external dependencies.

## Test Coverage
- Target at least 80% test coverage for business-critical components.
- Regularly review uncovered code to ensure critical paths are always tested.

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- Run automated tests on every commit using CI pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).
- Include linting, formatting, and static analysis checks in CI workflows.

## Test Data Management
- Use realistic, anonymized data for testing.
- Refresh test databases regularly and automatically to maintain integrity.

## Error Handling & Logging
- Ensure that tests verify correct logging and error handling behaviors.
- Validate edge-case scenarios explicitly to ensure robustness.

## Security Testing
- Regularly run automated vulnerability scanning tools on dependencies.
- Conduct penetration testing periodically, especially for public-facing applications.

## Performance & Load Testing
- Include load-testing scenarios to verify system performance under stress.
- Benchmark critical queries regularly to detect performance regressions early.
