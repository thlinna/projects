# PLAN: Development of the Digital Europe AI Funding Generator

## 1. Executive Summary
This project leverages the Agno framework to build a multi-agent system that automates the ideation, evaluation, and application process for funding proposals under the Digital Europe Programme. The goal is to rapidly produce high-quality proposals that significantly boost funding success rates while reducing manual work.

## 2. Scope and Objectives
- **Scope:** Develop an MVP that includes the four main agents (Ideanikkari, Arvioija, Hakija, Rahoittaja) with a modular, event-driven design.
- **Objectives:**
  - Integrate state-of-the-art AI models for idea generation and evaluation.
  - Build a responsive UI that guides users through the proposal creation process.
  - Implement robust backend services using Agno for orchestration.
  - Ensure compliance with EU data protection standards and Digital Europe criteria.

## 3. Key Deliverables
- A fully functional web-based platform with:
  - User registration, project management, and multi-user collaboration.
  - AI-driven idea generation (Ideanikkari) and evaluation (Arvioija).
  - Automated proposal drafting (Hakija) and final review (Rahoittaja).
  - Export functionality (PDF/DOCX) and integration options with external systems.
- Documentation including PRD, technical architecture, and user guides.
- Initial pilot testing with a limited user group and feedback collection.

## 4. Project Timeline and Milestones
- **Phase 1: Requirements & Architecture (2 weeks)**
  - Finalize PRD and PLAN documentation.
  - Design system architecture and agent interaction flows using Agno.
- **Phase 2: Core Agent Development (6–8 weeks)**
  - Develop and integrate Ideanikkari and Arvioija agents.
  - Build basic UI/UX for user registration and project initiation.
- **Phase 3: Proposal Generation Module (4–6 weeks)**
  - Develop Hakija agent for automated proposal drafting.
  - Implement content validation (length, structure, compliance).
- **Phase 4: Final Evaluation & Export (3–4 weeks)**
  - Develop Rahoittaja agent for final proposal review.
  - Integrate export functions and external system connections.
- **Phase 5: Testing, Optimization & Pilot (3–4 weeks)**
  - Conduct security, performance, and usability testing.
  - Run pilot tests with real users, collect feedback, and iterate.

## 5. Team Composition and Resources
- **Team Size:** 6–8 members
  - 1 Product Manager / Strategist
  - 2–3 AI & Backend Developers
  - 1–2 Frontend Developers
  - 1 UX/UI Designer
  - 1 QA/Test Engineer
- **Key Tools and Technologies:**
  - Agno framework for agent orchestration.
  - Cloud services (AWS/Azure) for scalability.
  - Modern JavaScript frameworks for frontend (React/Vue).
  - Secure data storage compliant with GDPR.
  - Integration with popular project management tools (Asana, Trello).

## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation
- **High AI Operation Costs:** Monitor usage and optimize AI model calls.
- **Data Privacy Concerns:** Enforce strict encryption and regular audits.
- **Integration Challenges:** Develop modular components with clear APIs.
- **Changing Funding Criteria:** Implement dynamic updates via Agno’s event system.

## 7. Next Steps and Roadmap
- **Immediate Next Steps:**
  - Review PRD and PLAN with stakeholders.
  - Set up development environments and secure necessary AI API access.
  - Begin Phase 1 with requirements finalization and architectural design.
- **Long-Term Roadmap:**
  - Expand agent capabilities and add support for additional funding programmes.
  - Develop advanced analytics for proposal performance.
  - Consider a SaaS model with subscription-based access and premium features.
